        <li>680g Coles Mum's Sause Bolognese</li>
        <br>
        <li>250ml (1 cup) Massel chicken style liquid stock</li>
        <br>
        <li>1 tbsp dried oregano leaves</li>
        <br>
        <li>600ml ctn pouring cream</li>
        <br>
        <li>3 eggs, lightly whisked</li>
        <br>
        <li>300g (3 cups) coarsely grated three cheese mix</li>
        <br>
        <li>250g pkt dried lasagne sheets</li>
        <br>
        <li>Fresh curly parsley leaves, to serve</li>
        <br>
    </ul>

    <h4>Method</h4>
    <ol id="method">
        <li>Heat the oil in a large frying pan over high heat. Cook the mince, stirring with a wooden spoon to break up
            any lumps, for 10 minutes or until the mince changes colour. Add the tomato paste. Cook, stirring, for 1
            minute to coat. Add the wine. Cook for 1 minute or until the wine evaporates. Add the pasta sauce, stock and
            oregano. Season. Simmer for 10 minutes or until reduced slightly.</li>
        <br><br>
        <li>Meanwhile, whisk the cream and eggs in a bowl until well combined. Season. Stir in 2 cups cheese.</li>
        <br><br>
        <li>Grease the insert of a 3.5L slow cooker. Spread a thin layer of the mince mixture over the base of the
            insert. Cover with a layer of lasagne sheets, breaking the sheets to fit, if necessary. Drizzle one-fifth of
            the cream mixture over the lasagne sheets and top with one-quarter of the remaining mince mixture. Continue
            layering with remaining lasagne sheets, cream mixture and mince mixture, finishing with a layer of cream
            mixture. Sprinkle with remaining 1 cup cheese.</li>
        <br><br>
        <li>Cook on Low for 3 1/2 - 4 hours or until the lasagne sheets are tender and the liquid is mostly absorbed.
            Carefully remove the insert from the slow cooker. Set aside, covered, for 10-15 minutes to rest. Sprinkle
            with parsley.</li>
    </ol>
